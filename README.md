# Travel-agency-page
The following task was to implement all 7 points:

1. Add a gallery of photos (or pictures) to the page with a popup opening with an enlarged picture on the page and toggling left-to-right within the popup. The unnecessary arrow disappears on the outermost elements.
2. Smooth opening and closing of popup with feedback form.
3. Validation of the feedback form using non-built-in methods: phone number, email, text in Russian (or English) only. Sending a message by POST method to the provided address.
4. When validation is successful, the feedback button changes: first "sending", then "successfully sent" + visual changes (colour change, cursor view, disabled status).
5. Appearance of any message (popup) after 30 seconds of being on the page. Possibility to close it. Handling re-opening after reloading (does not appear if it was closed by the user).
6. Change the page style to black and white (or if you originally have such, to some bright colours) when clicking on a button or link in the footer by means of JavaScript. This increases the font size of the headers by about 10px.
7. When clicking on a button or link in the footer on the site, it starts to rain when the screen width is greater than 800px. The rain stops or starts raining again when changing the screen width in the developer tools (or changing the browser window size). 

For the main theme I created "Travel agency" that organise trips to mountains. No mobile version was requrired, therefore it was not implemented for this project
